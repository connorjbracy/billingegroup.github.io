 synopsis = {Non negative matrix factorization was tested against simulated and real PDF data from the discharge of a battery electrode.  It was shown that, although this is a purely mathematical data reduction process, it resulted in mathematical components that strongly resembled real physical components in the system, and weights that closely followed the time evolution of the real physical components.  Software was also presented that allowed nmf to take place even when data were streaming from an experiment as well as in batch mode from a finished experiment.},
