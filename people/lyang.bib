This work was supported as part of the Fluid Interface Reactions, Structures and Transport (FIRST) Center, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, and Office of Basic Energy Sciences. C. C. was supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council. L.Y.’s effort on PDF analysis and modeling was supported by the NSF MRSEC program through Columbia in the Center for Precision Assembly of Superstratic and Superatomic Solids (DMR-1420634). X-ray PDF measurements were conducted on beamline 28-ID2 of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLSII), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Brookhaven National Laboratory under contract no. DE-SC0012704. Use of the beamline X17A of the NSLS was supported by the DOE-BES under contract no. DEAC02-98CH10886 This research used resources at the Spallation Neutron Source, a DOE Office of Science User Facility operated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
