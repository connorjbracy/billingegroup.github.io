 ackno = {The authors are grateful for the instrumental beam times allocated at the large-scale radiation facilities. The synchrotron-radiation powder-diffraction experiments were performed at BL44B2 in SPring-8 with the approval of RIKEN. The X-ray total-scattering experiments were performed on beamline ID11 at the ESRF, Grenoble, France. We are grateful to Gavin Vaughan at the ESRF for providing assistance in using beamline ID11. A portion of this research used resources at the SNS, a DOE Office of Science User Facility operated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We are grateful to Mikhail Feygenson at the SNS for providing assistance in using the NOMAD instrument. Affiliation with the Center for Integrated Materials Research (iMAT) at Aarhus University is gratefully acknowledged. Funding information. This work was financially supported by the Danish National Research Foundation (Center for Materials Crystallography, DNRF93), Innovation Fund Denmark (Green Chemistry for Advanced Materials, GCAM-4107-00008B), and the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation via the instrument center DanScatt. Work in the Billinge group was supported by US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (DOE-BES) under contract No. DE-SC0012704. Use of the NOMAD beamline was sponsored by the Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of BES, US DOE. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is operated under DOE Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725. KMØJ is grateful to the Carlsberg Foundation for support through grant CF14-0652.},
